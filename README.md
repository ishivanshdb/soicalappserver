# soicalappserver
This is a code repository for api creation and mongo db connection. 
Using Express & MongoDB I tried to create backend server of an app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

#Setup:
run npm i to install the modules && add .env file for to add MongoDB connection URL && npm start to run the server.
